        <p style="color:aliceblue">
            We are four second-year Computer Science students at UNC-Chapel Hill.

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color:aliceblue">Our Mission</h2>
        <p style="color:aliceblue">
            By creating simple games, we aim to bring fun and entertainment to our Tar Heel Community. We also intend to
            tighten the connections within the Tar Heels community. Students may find themselves knowing better about
            their professors after playing our game.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color:aliceblue">Description of the Game</h2>
        <p style="color:aliceblue">
            Before the game, users should keep one UNC CS professor in mind.
            Once beginning the game, users are directed to answer several multiple-choice questions. Our
            “thought-reading” Encyclopedia is (hopefully) able to guess who is the professor in your mind!
            After several rounds of the game, we hope to help Tar Heels to familiarize our CS professors (their fun
            facts, roles, research interests, etc.).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color:aliceblue">Behind the scene</h2>
        <p style="color:aliceblue">
            We made a database that contains the information of 51 UNC CS professors, including their title, age,
            gender, etc. Each time the player answers our question, we can narrow down the professor list. Step by step,
            the one and only correct professor will remain.
