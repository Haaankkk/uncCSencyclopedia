# uncCSencyclopedia
Our Team
We are four second-year Computer Science students at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Our Mission
By creating simple games, we aim to bring fun and entertainment to our Tar Heel Community. 
We also intend to tighten the connections within the Tar Heels community. 
Students may find themselves knowing better about their professors after playing our game.

Description of the Game
Before the game, users should keep one UNC professor in mind. 
Once beginning the game, users are directed to answer several multiple-choice questions. 
Our “thought-reading” Encyclopedia is (hopefully) able to guess who is the professor in your mind! 
After several rounds of the game, 
we hope to help Tar Heels to familiarize our CS professors (their fun facts, roles, research interests, etc.).

Behind the scene
We made a database that contains the information of 51 UNC CS professors, including their title, age, gender, etc. 
Each time the player answers our question, we can narrow down the professor list. 
Step by step, the one and only correct professor will remain.
